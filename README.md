### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Before writing any code, I thoroughly reviewed all design files and assets. This ensured I had a clear understanding of what needed to be implemented. Having this clarity allowed me to create a well-planned structure for the HTML and CSS, ensuring I didn't miss any key elements.

Once I understood the visual layout and requirements, I moved on to coding. I focused on writing semantic HTML5, which not only improves accessibility but also makes it easier to maintain the code.

For example, instead of using generic div tags, I used meaningful elements like header, main, and footer to make the code more readable.

Overall, this project has been an excellent learning opportunity, reinforcing the importance of semantic structure, reusable CSS, and maintaining an organized workflow using version control.
